# Superstore Project Outline

## Introduction
This project uses the Superstore Sales Dataset to perform business analysis, develop data analyst skills, and implement machine learning. The dataset includes sales, customer, product, and order data from a fictional retail superstore.

## Objectives
- Conduct business analysis on sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
- Build data analyst skills in data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- Implement machine learning to predict outcomes like profit.

## Dataset
- **Source**: [Superstore Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
- **Columns**: Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Ship Mode, Customer ID, Customer Name, Segment, Country, City, State, Postal Code, Region, Product ID, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name, Sales, Quantity, Discount, Profit
- **Size**: 9,994 rows, 19 columns

## Project Steps
1. **Data Acquisition and Understanding**
   - Download dataset and load into Python with pandas.
   - Review structure and columns.

2. **Data Exploration**
   - Calculate summary statistics (sales, profit, quantity).
   - Visualize distributions and correlations.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical variables for modeling.

4. **Business Analysis**
   - Analyze sales and profit by category, region, segment.
   - Examine trends over time using Order Date.

5. **Machine Learning Model Development**
   - Predict profit using features like sales, quantity, discount.
   - Train and evaluate a model (e.g., linear regression).

6. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
   - Summarize findings.
   - Provide business recommendations.
